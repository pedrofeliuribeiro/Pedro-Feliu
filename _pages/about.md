My academic trajectory starts with the under graduation in International Relations at PUC-SP between the years 2001 and 2004. Following, I obtained my master and PhD in political science at the University of São Paulo (DCP-USP). Since the beggining my research agenda consisted of understanding the role and influence of domestic actors in formulating foreign policy in Latin America. More specifically, political parties, legislative behavior and Executive – Legislative relations. 
I started my teaching career in 2007 as a professor of international relations at Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, São Paulo, Brazil, where I taught for 3 years. Then I was a professor at the Federal University of Paraíba, Brazil, for four years in the Department of International Relations. I am currently an associate professor at the Institute of International Relations at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, since 2014. The study of multiparty presidentialism and foreign policy decision making in Latin America has been the main research interest so far.
