My academic trajectory has always been related to International Relations and Political Science, both teaching and researching. Quantitative methods have been as well a constant investment in my academic formation. My main fields of expertise are foreign policy analysis and legislative studies, with an empirical emphasis in Latin American countries. I am interested in understanding legislative behavior, political parties, Executive-Legislative relations, changes in foreign policy, decision making process in foreign policy, bureaucratic politics and media and foreign policy.
