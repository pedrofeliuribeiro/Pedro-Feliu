Abstract



Does national media news coverage affect the behavior of legislators when deciding foreign policy matters? 
This article aims to disentangle the relationship between the media and legislative behavior in foreign policy, 
using Paraguay as a case study. We analyze the level of public debate on international affairs, 
measured by the frequency of news in the newspaper ABC Color in the six months before the roll-call votes on the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay. 
The literature on Latin American studies finds a lack of parliamentary interest in foreign affairs due to low voter attention to this subject, 
and therefore a low impact on reelections. We find the relationship between parliamentary polarization and public interest in a bill to be mediated by mass media. 
After estimating a Tobit model, we observe a significant and positive relationship between the news coverage a law receives and the degree of polarization among parliamentarians. 
Thus, our empirical evidence contradicts the idea that there is a lack of electoral interest in foreign policy. We confirm this finding through qualitative data gathered from in-depth interviews.
