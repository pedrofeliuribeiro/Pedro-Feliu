Abstract

In this article, we provide a framework to analyze the foreign policy overstretch of middle powers, that is, their recent tendency to expand foreign policy goals and ambitions beyond their capabilities. We propose that
overstretch results from the interaction of permissive international environments and the collusion of domestic actors to produce foreign policy
myths. These myths, in turn, justify unsustainable swelling of foreign policy expenditures until they are shattered. After laying out our theory, we
test it against the case of twenty-first-century Brazil. First, we document
how interest groups logrolled to foster and capitalize on a “myth of multipolarity,” which, once entrenched in elite discourse and public opinion,
resulted in a tangible overgrowth of foreign policy. Second, we show the
extent of overstretch across four indicators—number of embassies, participation in peacekeeping operations, membership in international organizations, and aid projects overseas—using the synthetic control method to
compare Brazil with a plausible counterfactual.
