Course Description
======

This course aims to introduce students to the theoretical approaches that guide the study of international relations. The discipline focuses on classical theoretical approaches - those that maintain a direct connection with Classical Political Theory from the origins of the modern State, in 1648, until the middle of the 20th century. The course aims to examine the contribution of classical authors to the study of international relations and the especificity of the discipline in the social sciences. For this purpose, complementary readings seek to reinforce the connection between classical literature and the problems that the student of international relations faces on a daily basis.
